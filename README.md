# John D Hunter Excellence in Plotting 2020

This repository contains my submission for the John D Hunter Excellence in
Plotting 2020 contest. Inside there are files related to the simulation that
I carried out, the rendering of the animation which is my submission, and
some supporting material.

* `jdh.mx3`: This is the configuration file for the [Mumax3][mumax]
  micromagnetic simulator that I used to simulate the domain wall motion. It
  contains material parameters derived from work that was done at Tampere
  University in a study of domain wall motion and Barkhausen noise in
  disordered magnetic materials.
* `xy.png`: This is a set of axes used in the animation before the simulation
  begins. In the animation, it is used to indicate the size of the simulated
  film. It was generated using [Inkscape][inkscape].
* `preprocess.py`: This script converts the binary `.ovf` files generated by
  mumax to a single numpy array, and stores the array in a `.npy` file, which
  is faster and more straightforward to load into blender.

### Blender Scripts
* `populate_cones.py`: This script generates the array of cones which represent
  magnetization at each point in the simulation space. Then, the orientation
  of each cone is animated at every output simulation time. Additionally, the
  color of each cone is animated for each frame, using Matplotlib's `RdBu_r`
  colormap to map the z-component of the magnetization to the material color.
* `flip_cones.py`: Due to the way in which the orientation of objects between
  keyframes is determined, in certain cases blender incorrectly determines the
  rotation of objects. This script identifies incorrectly rotated cones
  and corrects their rotation.
* `demo_rotate.py`: This script is used at the beginning of the animation during
  before the simulation data is shown. It is used to color the cone at (0, 0)
  during the part where it rotates up and down.

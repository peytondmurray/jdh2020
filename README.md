# John D Hunter Excellence in Plotting 2020

This repository contains my submission for the John D Hunter Excellence in
Plotting 2020 contest. Inside there are files related to the simulation that
I carried out, the rendering of the animation which is my submission, and
some supporting material.

* `jdh.mx3`: This is the configuration file for the [Mumax3][mumax]
  micromagnetic simulator that I used to simulate the domain wall motion. It
  contains material parameters derived from work that was done at Tampere
  University in a study of domain wall motion and Barkhausen noise in
  disordered magnetic materials.
